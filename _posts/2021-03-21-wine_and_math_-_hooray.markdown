For this week's blog, I want to discuss another article I read because of Data Science Weekly. The article in question is [Wine & Math: A model pairing](http://https://pudding.cool/2021/03/wine-model/) by Lars Verspohl. Again, I am stunned by the format of this article. It's so interactive, and of course I enjoyed building my own high quality wine. Similar to the article I blogged about last week, I feel like making the material interactive just really made this special. I may be biased, because I'm already familiar with predictive modeling, but I thought this information was presented in a really efficient way.   

I may seem like a broken record at this point, but what I'm noticing about the articles that are chosen is that the visuals are top notch. It's so much easier for the audience to understand the point that the scientist is making when they can look at a visualization. I would be curious to know how this page was formatted to make it so interactive, although I get the feeling that this is where it gets out of my domain. I'll have to ask my software engineering friends!  

It's a rather short post for tonight, but I'm glad you read. As always, feel free to reach out with any comments, I'd love feedback. Until next week!
