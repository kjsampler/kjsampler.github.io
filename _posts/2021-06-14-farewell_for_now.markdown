Prepare for one last non-technical blog post. But one that promises to be cathartic nonetheless. June 19 marks 180 days from my job search start date, and because of that I will be parting ways with Flatiron School. I am... extraordinarily proud of myself, and so grateful to Flatiron School for how much I have learned in my time as a student and job seeker here. I did not have any background in tech whatsoever, and some (including myself) thought I was crazy to take this on.  

My time doing the coursework was far from easy. I had countless breakdowns, and more times than I cared to admit, I believed I would fail. Fortunately, I had a supportive husband, an incredible ed coach, and an instructor who I couldn't begin to thank enough. I had to learn what worked for me, and what didn't. And even when I hated it, I had to power through. And the craziest thing happened- I started to love it. I saw the potential, and I started to understand what my colleagues were talking about. I started to really see myself as a new person- a programmer. When I passed my capstone, I was a little in awe. Not because I didn't think I deserved it, but because I knew I had finally done it- I had learned this.  

The job search has not been easy. By any means. It has been another learning curve as I figure out what works and what is just not a good use of time. I've met so many awesome people as a result of my networking efforts. And I've had A LOT of rejection, and even more experience being ignored. And that's okay. Everyone says "it will happen when it happens", and nobody likes to hear that, but it's true. A few weeks ago I wrote about resilience, and I think that was a real turning point for me. You can't let rejection determine how you view yourself or what you're capable of. I've since started volunteering with Omdena which is so far one of my favorite experiences in my tech career.  

There are so many emotions right now. It is hard not to feel disappointed, or down on myself for not finding a job by now. I think those feelings are inevitable. But I am also met with so much pride. I didn't think I could do this, and here I am, doing it. Whether I have found a job or not, I've learned an amazing new skill that will make my life better. I'm so grateful to Flatiron School- the organization does such a great job meeting the needs of individual students and truly setting you up to succeed. I've been through so much since I started- family emergencies, my own hospitalization, changing "day jobs", and through it all, I've had data science to fall back on, to be my safe place and something that brings me comfort.  

I'm afraid that this may be my last post at this site. I may start another technical blog, so if you're interested in following along I would encourage you to follow me on [Linked In.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaycee-sampler-a96688186/) This journey has been wonderful. And awful. And amazing. In my weak moments, I was afraid I made a mistake. It was never a mistake- this is one of the best decisions I've ever made for myself.  
Part of my study space is to light a scented candle, and tonight, as I'm writing this blog, the old one burns out and I've lit a new one. It smells like fresh possibilities, new perspectives, and moving forward. Thank you so much for reading.
