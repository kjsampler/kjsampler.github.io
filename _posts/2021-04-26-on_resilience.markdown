Be prepared for another non-technical post here. It's been a rough week for this job searcher. I faced another rejection, and realized that I've been at this in earnest for four months now. It's been a long four months! And rather than mope and day dream about giving up, I've had a word stuck in my head. Resilience. "The capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness." One of Flatiron's values is scrapiness. It's tempting to wallow, but I think this is where scrapiness comes in. Toughness. Resilience.  

The first lesson of resilience is to take each difficulty as a learning opportunity. For this, it has meant improving my technical interviewing skills each time. That has definitely been the thorn in my side, but opening up about my difficulties with it has prompted people to offer advice. Some advice I just got today? Flashcards. It never occured to me, but I see the usefulness of it. And once you have a subject narrowed down, there are so many resources to help you become well versed for an interview. For SQL questions in particular, I have found HackerRank really helpful.  

The next lesson I've learned is to actively ask for criticism and feedback. One of my favorite rejection letters (sounds weird, I know) included specifics about what I was lacking and even offered methods for how to improve it. The most devastating rejections have been the ones where I have gotten generic no-reply emails and even been ghosted after interviewing. It stings at first, but at least with feedback I can see how real professionals see my work and know what to improve on, not just for my job search but for my development as a programmer.  

Hand in hand with that, I'm learning to recognize my greatest pitfalls as a programmer. These ones aren't as easy to look at. I knew that I was going to have difficulty because of my lack of bachelor's degree. What has surprised me is that it hasn't been as big of a problem as I thought it would be. The feedback that I'm getting consistently is that the organizations are looking for someone with more experience. At first, that was extremely frustrating. How do I get experience without getting a job? Resilience in this case means finding a way too. I am currently looking at volunteer organizations to gain real world experience, network, and (most of all) use my skills for good.  

When I think of the word resilience, I think of my cousin who is a body builder. She spends months preparing for shows, and brings it her all. After the judging comes out, no matter the outcome, she allows herself a moment of rest. Then she takes her feedback and uses it to become an even greater athlete. It fuels her fire. That's what resilience looks like to me. I can day dream about giving up all I want, but at the end of the day, I realize that this is the career for me, and there's truly nothing else I'd rather be doing. I took my moment of rest, and I'm ready to take the "judge's" feedback and use it to fuel my own fire. I promise a more technical post next week!
