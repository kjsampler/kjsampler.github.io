Hi all! I'm excited to say the topic of this blog post is my newest opportunity: I will be working on a project through Omdena for the next 8 weeks. I'm so excited to see the project life cycle and the people that I will be meeting.  

The project goal is to build an MVP (minimum viable product) for the group Human Rights First to use NLP to monitor for human rights violations. The team will have the opportunity to "evaluate social phenomena across the globe in near real-time" (Omdena's project website). It looks like the product will be a dashboard that a user can log into and see the analyzed data in real time.  

One piece that I am most excited for is to see how everyone in the team fits together. I am joining as a junior ML engineer, and there are going to be 49 other professionals working on this project. I'm so excited to see what the collaboration looks like and who is responsible for which piece of the project.   

I know this is another short post, but I promise to keep the blog updated with whatever information I can! This is such an exciting opportunity with such a great mission. I'm very happy to be reporting some good news. I'll follow up and let everyone know how the first week goes!
