Why did I choose data science? 

The answer is fairly straightforward – I love working with data. I’m currently a pharmacy vault technician. This means that I’m in charge of the controlled substances for our hospital. As part of my job, I try to track trends to see what’s going in and out of the vault, maintain inventory, and try to find the most efficient way to provide medications to our patients. As you can imagine, this involves generating a lot of reports – a lot of data.
		
My favorite part of my job is finding better ways to use data. I believe that good usage of data can improve the efficiency throughout an organization. It’s not just about what you measure, it’s how you use it. I hope that helps me in my journey to becoming a data scientist.
		
My brother is actually the reason that I found a coding bootcamp. He took a C++ class in college and introduced me to coding. I knew I wanted something where I would be challenged, and coding was definitely challenging to me. I started listening to podcasts and coding a little on Internet sites, and I was hooked. Honestly, Python just clicked for me. I loved the fact that you could use Python to perform tasks that I was already trying to do on Excel Spreadsheets.
	
I’ve always been interested in math and science and I think that data science is the perfect marriage of the two. There’s an element of challenge and continuing education that I believe will continue to excite me throughout my career. Since starting with The Flatiron School, I’ve found a community of other people who are just as passionate as I am, and that makes a huge difference. I chose data science because I know it’s something I’ll enjoy doing, and continue to be passionate about long after graduation.
