In more ways than one. Feb 21 marked two months that I've been in the job market. It's emotionally draining, but good things are coming. After looking rejection in the face, I sat down to code. I fiddled and adjusted, trying to force a function to work that just isn't going to work. And my end of week reflection is showing me what I need: a change of plans. Just like in my personal project that I've been working on (read: dedicated my coding time time), I've been trying to force my career search into a function that it just doesn't want to be forced into. And I think that maybe my rules for writing functions can help in my professional development.  

1. What problem am I trying to solve?  

This is what my high school English teacher would call the "so what?" Why am I writing this function? What is the big picture? In my professional life; why am I doing what I'm doing?  

2. Start practicing on a test set.  
 
When I write a function, it's always easier to use a concrete example. If you were explaining addition, it would be easier to explain 2 + 2 = 4, rather than try to explain addition in a general sense. When I'm coding, I take a subset of data, or create a small dataset, so that I can track exactly how my blossoming function works. In the real world, maybe practicing on a test set looks like branching out and sharing my code with professionals. It's hard to share something that you are still a beginner at, but the criticism ultimately makes you better.  

3. Slowly add the pieces together  

Once I have performed all my code in seperate blocks, and it runs, then I can start adding them together in the function. Of course, this also means adjusting the code to work for a more general dataset. And while it seems like that should be easy, sometimes it really isn't. Sometimes you realize that you've written code that only works for your subset. So you go back to step 2. And it's fun because you start to see your function take shape. It looks real and official and smart, and like something to be proud of. This part is a little different in the career search. It looks like a polished resume and LinkedIn assessments and Udemy courses and of course a growing portfolio. I don't know that you go back to step 2, but I think going back to step 1 is important. Why am I doing this? Am I making choices because I love what I do, or just to get a job?  

4. Run, debug, and run again (and again...)

Odds are, the first function you write isn't going to be the final one. Because you will look at your completed function, and of course you want to run it on everything  you can. But in doing so, you might realize that it doesn't handle edge cases. Maybe your function can't handle negative numbers, or appends the exact same value into every row of your output dataframe. The important part here is that you are testing every possible scenario, and making your function more adaptable and more useful for it. I think the parallel to the career search is almost too obvious here. You keep at it. You test the edge cases, and see what doesn't work. You make the function (you) more adaptable.  

And then you have this really cool function. It came from you and does exactly what you needed it to; and it's so much simpler than running all that code over and over again. I get really proud of my functions. I enjoy writing them, because I like to solve problems efficiently. Maybe by viewing my professional life as something that I can tackle in a similar way will lead to a more rewarding experience. Maybe not. That's step 4 again.  

All this to say, my function that recursively made predictions on my univariate model (yes, I'm back to the Dog License project) is just not going to work for the multivariate. Maybe there's a way to adjust it, but for now, I'm going to go back to step 1. What problem do I want to solve? I'll try to get that finished this week and hopefully share with everyone next week.  

As always, if you're reading this, thank you so much! If you have any questions, comments, criticisms, etc., please reach out. I'd love to hear it! See you all next week!
