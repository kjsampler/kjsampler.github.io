Tonight's blog is courtesy of Data Science Weekly and their curated choice of article [The Data Visualizations Behind COVID-19 Skepticism](http://http://vis.mit.edu/covid-story/) . I belong to several different social groups, and so I personally have heard the anti-mask arguments, and the arguments to keep wearing them. That is not the subject of this blog post though. What I really loved about this article was their own choice of visualization, and larger discussion of the responsible use of data.  

Going through Flatiron's data science program, I immediately recognized their use of the network diagram. What was delightful about this was that they clearly labeled and colored the clusters, and even formatted the page to hone in one whichever cluster you are reading about. The visual appeal was great, and helped to drive home what I believe was the authors' main point- the impact of visualizations when presenting data. Furthermore, as you read about the clusters, you see a sample of some of the group's visualizations. There were definitely groups that maintained a more professional image, and some groups that published very amatuer level visualizations.  

It is important to note, and I'm glad that they did, that there's not always benefit in publishing what the article refers to as "unmediated access to data"- that is, raw data. I particularly enjoyed this quote "Making and interpreting data visualizations are not objective or dispassionate processes; they are social and political endeavors that animate stories shaped by personal experiences and cultural interpretations." In the midst of a crisis, in the age of big data, we are seeing how easy it is to use the same set of data to draw very different conclusions.  

As data scientists (or other data professionals), sometimes it is easy to draw our conclusions and think of the visualizations as an afterthought. Besides delving into the reasoning behind some of these anti-mask clusters, this article has thrown into relief just how important it is to be responsible with our own visualizations. As a new Tableau user, visualizations have been on my mind a lot lately in my personal projects, and I think this article came at a great time for me personally. I believe that this article comes at a great time in our current crisis too. We may not be able to stop people from using data and visualizations in a misleading way, but we can educate everyone about the potential for data to be used to support individual agendas, and to therefore view new information with a critical eye.
