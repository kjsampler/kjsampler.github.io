This week's edition of new tech with Kaycee- Snowflake! This is another one that I've been seeing on a lot of employer wish-lists. In celebration of having an interview tomorrow, I thought I'd do another high level overview of what it is, and how I could learn more.  

In reading a little about the history of Snowflake, I am initally impressed by the name. It looks like the name was chosen because of the founder's love of winter sports. As a Colorado raised programmer, I love that. In a very general sense, Snowflake is a cloud based data warehouse. It was initially founded in 2012 and as of 2014 runs on Amazon S3, which is the stack that I'm curious about.  

The website makes an excellent observation- by keeping data cloud based, you don't have to worry about old or "stale" data being moved. They provide functionalities for data warehouses and lakes, engineering pipelines, data science modeling, apps and sharing. Another benefit of the cloud is that in a world where big data keeps getting bigger, there is not the same worry about storage as businesses would have with traditional hard drives.  

Without signing up for Snowflake, I needed to look into how it's used. A key piece of this is that Snowflake was built completely for the cloud- it's not built on software like Hadoop. It has its own SQL style query engine. What is interesting to me is that once data is entered, the metadata and organization is completely handled by Snowflake. It isn't viewable as an object even to the customer; they have to use the query engine to access the data they need. Another interesting feature is the number of ways that a customer could connect to Snowflake- from a web-based login to connecting a Tableau dashboard. I can definitely see the uses from a business side.  

I wasn't sure what to expect with Snowflake, but it really seems like a streamlined solution to data storage. The website features several tutorials, as well as hands-on labs. I hope that I get the chance to see this in practice soon. Until next time!
