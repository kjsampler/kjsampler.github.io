So I've been noticing these two words in almost every job posting I see- Scrum and Agile. And in the weird world of programming languages, I thought that these were just two more flavors that I hadn't learned yet. In a recent coffee meeting, I was asked if I was familiar with scrum, and I had to honestly answer no. I was prepared to learn about a new language or even worse get the "oh, well that's okay too."  

My basic explanation was that it is actually a way to manage projects. The scrum master keeps things moving along. Each project is broken into sprints to keep it manageable. In this particular place, they can pick up pieces of a sprint (an increment) that they have assigned a point value to. At the end of the sprint (which was typically a week at this company), they reviewed how many points people were able to accomplish. An important part to their work place was that they estimated their max number of points, and then limited developers to only pick up about 75% of that- in case stuff happens. I was encouraged to hear that if somebody was getting close to the end of the sprint and hadn't finished their points for the week, the team pulled together and helped out. It seemed like a nice balance of autonomy and teamwork, which would be vital as a beginner. It is important to note that Scrum is actually a framework of Agile. 

So next I had to learn about scrum's best friend- Agile. I haven't been able to speak to anyone about Agile specifically, so this summary is coming from research. While scrum lays out the building blocks, Agile prides itself on being a people focused methodology. And a key to that is the concept of "just enough" planning. Just like scrum, Agile takes a huge project and breaks it into the smallest manageable increments. This helps prevent losing a year of work with traditional "roll out" models that seem to bet it all on one due date. It also makes sense that when teams are able to take ownership of a project and the way it is completed, they tend to exceed expectations.  

After learning about this, I'm extremely excited by how often I'm seeing Scrum and Agile in job ads. I personally work best breaking a project into manageable pieces and to see that this is the standard in data roles is very encouraging. It has seemed a little nebulous as to how projects are completed, but this framework is perfectly suited to programming. That's all for this week. Just a short burst of something new. Until next week!
