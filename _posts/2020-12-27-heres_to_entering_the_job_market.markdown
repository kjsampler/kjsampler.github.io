> 	A couple weeks ago, I graduated from Flatiron School. I am still enveloped in a warm sense of pride just typing those words. But along with the pride comes a tension, because now I’m on to my next big adventure. Now, I am officially job searching.  
	I’m so excited. And nervous. And uncertain. I’ve been working in pharmacy for six years now- I’m good at it. I’m not the new kid anymore. And by taking this momentous step forward by graduating a coding bootcamp, I am subjecting myself to being the new kid again. I think back to all the struggle and awkward moments as I learned pharmacy, and both dread and accept with open arms the fact that I will be in that position again soon.  
	I realize that this post is not technical. But I think the human element of tech is just as important. There’s a person behind the code, and it’s always good to share your personality with those you share your code with as well. I’m gearing up for what I assume will be an emotional and sometimes exhausting time. But what I’m really excited for is the people I will meet. Networking, even when you aren’t specifically looking for a job, is really valuable. You get to meet new people in your field, and find new leaders to be inspired by, and get feedback to make you a better scientist. The opportunities that I’ve already had to meet others in tech have been incredible.  
	Not only am I looking forward to networking, I am also so looking forward to learning on my own still. I loved being a Flatiron Student and the constant challenge of learning something new was invaluable to me. I’m so thrilled that I have a base set of skills and have the resources to keep learning and trying to stay abreast of what the ever changing tech world throws my way.  
	And the projects that I get to complete now! Especially while brainstorming for my capstone project, there were so many ideas that floated around my head. I’ve learned such valuable, real-world skills that I can work on projects that appeal to me, and solve problems that I see in my day-to-day life. I feel completely uninhibited in my personal projects. Stay tuned!  
	Expect more technical posts in the future, but as I kick off my job search, the new season, and the end of a tumultuous year, I wanted to pause and reflect. I look back on how far I’ve come with pride, and look forward to the future – whatever that may mean for me. So here’s to the new year, here’s to new beginnings, and here’s to entering the job market!
