Happy Sunday everyone! It's been a crazy week here with a lot going on. One thing that I'm learning a lot about lately is what the role of a Business Intelligence Analyst is. I'm particularly excited by this title because it represents a tie-in to the bigger picture of the company. There is nothing wrong with having a very code heavy position, but what seems the most interesting to me is one where I spend time coding but also presenting my analysis and remembering the big picture of how my work relates to the company and the end user. A part of business intelligence- proof of concept. So for tonight's post, I decided to do some research as to exactly what POC is and how it relates to a BI analyst position.  

The short answer is that proof of concept (or proof of principle) is developing a test product that experiments on the feasibility of the product. As a BI analyst, I can see where this would tie in- you want to make sure a product is actually going to work before spending time, money, and manpower to fully develop it, and risk deploying an ineffective product. The word that comes to mind is prototype, but I think POC refers more to a production design, whereas a prototype is the product itself; the difference lies in the part where POC involves testing feasibility.  

Aside from the research benefits, I imagine that POC makes for a better product in the long run. It can be very difficult, even on a team, to consider edge cases and to debug when there is not a (even somewhat) functioning product. I have read that in cases where a POC is presented to potential customers, they can provide direction for the final development which is invaluable to a business- it means the product will appeal better to the end user. Another benefit for software and tech is that a POC helps to determine the stack that the product will need to use, and can help to make improvements and future updates more efficient.  

The fun part of all of this is going to be learning how it is implemented in a business setting. I'm sure there is a lot of collaboration involved in a tech company. There is the software development team, the data science team, business intelligence, and in the later stages marketing to decide the best way to make a great product. There's sure to be a lot of moving parts and it seems like a really cool process to be a part of.  

As always, if anyone has experience with this and would like to correct me or ask any questions that could further my research I would absolutely appreciate it. This is completely new to me and I can't wait to find out more. I'm looking forward to another busy week and hope to have a lot to write about next week. Thanks for reading my post. Until next week!
